TODO:
- think out how to easier switch between different variants
- important features and variants
- hyperparameters
- training curves and standard errors
- action wrapper
- some design choices and justifications

Credit:
- I checked my code against https://github.com/Pechckin/MountainCar and borrowed its implementation of replay buffer which has faster sampling speed.
